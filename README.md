# Pong-AI

Small project that I've been working on to learn more about applications of AI. 


 

## AI-Overview

  The pong
  
### V1: 

  The first iteration of this pong AI was almost never successful against a human player. This is perhaps due to the very small amount of training data provided to the model. Despite losing almost every game, the AI did make some funny moves sometimes. For example it would sometimes just blindly copy my moves but as soon as I stopped moving my paddle it would bolt in the opposite direction on just stay in the corner of the screen. Other time it would make surprisingly move independent of my paddle's movements and hit the pong ball perfectly.
